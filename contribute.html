                        <p class="testimonial_para">I got involved with LSF as a volunteer back in 2019 for the election project. I initially thought it would be a one-off engagement. But instead, it opened the door to countless opportunities in my career. I was in charge of setting up processes to handle the entire deployment side of the election system and I was fortunate enough to work side-by-side with Dr. Sanjiva. It was a huge opportunity for me and I learned a lot from the entire experience. As for the perks, LSF provided really good food during the volunteer days, which in turn made me gain a few pounds (maybe this is a con?) All in all, my volunteer opportunity turned out to be one of the greatest highlights in my career and helped me gain experience and bragging rights. It was great to be able to make friends with other awesome, and similar-minded people in the volunteer pool.</p><br>
